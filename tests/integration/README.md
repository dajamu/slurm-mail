# Integration Tests

## Introduction

The `tests/integration` directory contains an automated test harness for Slurm-Mail. It makes use of the docker images created by the Docker files in the [docker-slurm](docker-slurm) sub directory.

## Adding new Slurm version support

When a new version of Slurm is released the Docker files in the [docker-slurm](docker-slurm) sub directory need to be updated to the new version and the images created and pushed to the `ghcr.io/neilmunday/slurm-mail` image repository. This is partially automated via the [slurm_version_check](../../.github/workflows/slurm_version_check.yml) and [build_docker_slurm](../../.github/workflows/build_docker_slurm.yml) workflows.

Each day [slurm_version_check](../../.github/workflows/slurm_version_check.yml) checks for new versions of Slurm. If a new version is found the workflow updates all of the files in the [docker-slurm](docker-slurm) directory with the new version string and creates a pull request.

When the pull request is merged the [build_docker_slurm](../../.github/workflows/build_docker_slurm.yml) workflow automatically creates the new Slurm-Mail docker images so they are ready to use.

Finally, the `../.github/workflows/testing.yml` workflow must be updated to include the new Slurm version.

## Adding tests

Slurm tests should be added to `tests.yml`.

A test is defined like so:

```yaml
  testX:
    # commands to run in batch script
    commands: |
      srun hostname  
    # test description
    description: one node test
    # is the job expected to fail?
    job_fail: false
    # sbatch options
    options:
      mail-type: ALL
      time: "01:00"
    # optionally specify any commands to run after job submission
    post_submit: |
      echo "I was run"
    # are errors expected in the slurm-send-mail log?
    send_errors: false
    # are errors expected in the slurm-spool-mail log?
    spool_errors: false
    # how many spool files are expected?
    spool_file_total: 2
```

## Running tests

The `run.sh` script is used to run the test suite against a particular version of Slurm.

The script performs the following tasks:

* Builds the Slurm-Mail RPM for the target OS
* Creates a temporary docker compose configuration to run a two node cluster
* Builds the head node image to include the Slurm-Mail RPM
* Starts the containers
* Initiates the test suite from the head node
* Stops the containers and removes the images

Within the image that is created for the head node, the `mail-server.py` script is used to create a simple mail server to process e-mails generated by Slurm-Mail.

The `run-tests.py` together with `tests.yml` are copied inside the head node image.

Once the head node container is up and running the `run.sh` script executes `run-tests.py` which submits the jobs defined in `tests.yml`. As each job runs the `run-tests.py` script checks if each job was processed as expected by Slurm-Mail.

A summary of how many tests passed and failed is printed at the end of the tests.

Excute all tests against Slurm 24.11.4 on Rocky Linux 9:

```bash
./run.sh -s 24.11.4 -o el9
```

Execute a particular test:

```bash
./run.sh -s 24.11.4  -o el9 -t test2
```

Enable verbose logging:

```bash
./run.sh -s 24.11.4 -o el9 -v
```

> **_Tip:_** As `run.sh` will build a Slurm-Mail RPM you can use the `-r` flag on subsequent invocations to skip building the RPM and thus save time.

## Testing e-mails

If you want to see how the e-mails will look in an e-mail client you can use the provided `demo.sh` script to start-up Slurm-Mail containers together with a [MailHog](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) container.

Usage:

```bash
./demo.sh -s SLURM_VERSION -o OS_VERSION [-p]
```

If the Slurm-Mail RPM has already been built and exists in this directory you can use `-p` option to skip building the RPM.

```bash
./demo.sh -s 24.05.0 -o el9
```

Once the containers are up and running you can access the [MailHog](https://hub.docker.com/r/mailhog/mailhog/) web GUI at http://localhost:8025

To submit jobs you can run the following command to launch an interactive bash shell:

```bash
docker exec -it slurm-mail-el9-24.05.0-head /usr/bin/bash -i
```

### Reverting to /usr/bin/mail

If you want to see how e-mails from Slurm look like instead, perform the following steps:

1. Disable the cron job at `/etc/cron.d/slurm-mail`

2. Install `sendmail`:

```bash
dnf install -y sendmail
```

3. Add to the end of `/etc/mail.rc`:

```
set smtp=mailhog:1025
```

4. Set `MailProg` in `/etc/slurm/slurm/conf` to `/usr/bin/mail`.

5. Restart `slurmctld`:

```bash
supervisorctl stop slurmctld
supervisorctl start slurmctld
```
